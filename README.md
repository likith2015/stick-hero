# stick-hero
In this Stick Hero game, players control a hero who must cross from one platform to another by drawing a stick of the right length. Players tap or click to extend the stick, and if it is long enough, the hero successfully crosses to the next platform. If the stick is too short or too long, the hero falls, and the game ends. The game tests players' precision and timing skills, challenging them to measure just the right distance. Simple controls and addictive gameplay make it a fun and engaging experience!
